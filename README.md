# DecisionMaker
Program to help decide between a variety of user input items.
### C++ Implementation
The functionality of the cpp file is to allow the user to insert items for the program to decide between then choose whether to receive an instant decision or "spin a wheel" for a decision. Upon spinning the wheel, the user can decide between to spin manually and receive statistics about spins every spin, or spin x amount of times and receive the totals after x spins.
### The Plan
1. Implement decision making functionality in Java in CLI.
2. Transfer functionality to GUI.
3. Improve GUI.
