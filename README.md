The functionality of the cpp file is to allow the user to insert items for the program to decide between then choose whether to receive an instant decision or "spin a wheel" for a decision. Upon spinning the wheel, the user can decide between to spin manually and receive statistics about spins every spin, or spin x amount of times and receive the totals after x spins.
